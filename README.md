```lua
getgenv().serverHopType = "RandomServer" -- "MostEmptyServer" or "RandomServer" (DO NOT REMOVE "")
-- (TEMPORARILY DISABLED) getgenv().autoexec = false -- if your exploit have no autoexec folder then change false to true 

getgenv().HeistsRobbing = true -- change true to false if you dont want to rob anything, only mini robberies autofarm

getgenv().robCasino = true
getgenv().robClub = true
getgenv().robBank = true

```

USE XENO OR JJSPLOIT AND PUT THE SCRIPT IN AUTOEXEC (don't work on solara)
how to do this? find "autoexec" folder in general folder of your e—Öploit, create txt file and paste the script
and yes, if your character didn't teleported normally to heist and stuck somewhere, that's cuz of anticheat, teleport method i use actually not very stable

"MostEmptyServer" servershop works like this:
you will not be teleported to the server you were on just now (due to this, there is less chance that you will be banned and + more chance that mini robberies will be full of cash).
It looking exclusively for servers with as few players as possible.
if you are not teleported anywhere for a long time (more than 1 minute), then it's okay, just wait.
"RandomServer" serverhop is just random server lol
